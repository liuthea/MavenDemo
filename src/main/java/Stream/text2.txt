    create method: ExecutorService(implement Executor),cachedThreadPool,Fixed~(n),Single~,Scheduled~
    command: ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
            service.execute();  //thread class implement runnable
            service.submit();   //callable
            service.shutdown();
communication between thread!!
Stream.iterate()
